# Apple-Inspired Content Strategy for NESS Energy

## Core Content Philosophy

### 1. Human-First Storytelling
- **Lead with emotions, follow with logic**: Start with how users feel, then provide technical validation
- **Real stories over specs**: Customer narratives are more powerful than technical specifications
- **Benefits over features**: What does it DO for users, not what it IS

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- **Reveal complexity gradually**: Start simple, allow users to dive deeper on demand
- **Respect user intent**: Give them what they need at the moment they need it
- **Layer information architecturally**: Surface level → detailed → expert

### 3. Confident Authority
- **Definitive statements**: "NESS ensures" not "NESS can help"
- **Quantified impact**: Specific numbers and proven results
- **Future-focused**: Position as inevitable evolution, not alternative choice
